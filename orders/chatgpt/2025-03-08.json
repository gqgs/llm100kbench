    "Based on the current market data from 2025-03-08, I’m reallocating most available USD into AAPL. Apple’s strong market cap and stable position in the tech sector suggest potential for growth, so converting approximately $99,931 into 418 shares of AAPL positions the portfolio for upward value movement while leaving a small cash remainder."
