    "Reduced Alphabet exposure by selling 10 GOOGL shares to reallocate capital into Apple, whose robust AI and growth outlook makes it our top pick for 2025. The proceeds from GOOGL sales (10×170.28 = $1702.80) allowed us to buy 7 AAPL shares (7×241.84 = $1692.88) with a $9.92 surplus, which we rounded to 10 USD to ensure net-zero cash flow."
