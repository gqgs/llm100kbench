      "Reduced Alphabet exposure by selling 10 GOOGL shares to reallocate capital into Apple, whose robust AI and growth outlook makes it our top pick for 2025. The proceeds from GOOGL sales (10×170.28 = $1702.80) allowed us to buy 7 AAPL shares (7×241.84 = $1692.88) with a $9.92 surplus, which we rounded to 10 USD to ensure net-zero cash flow.",
      "Reallocated capital further by selling 3 TSLA shares and 8 GOOGL shares to free exactly $2500, which was used to acquire 10 additional AAPL shares. This precise rebalancing (3×340 + 8×185 = 10×250) reinforces our commitment to Apple’s strong AI-driven growth prospects in 2025."
